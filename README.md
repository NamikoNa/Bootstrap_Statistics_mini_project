# Bootstrap_Statistics_mini_project
This was done as a part of Springboard Data Science Career Track course (Unit8.2.2. Bootstrap Statistics).  
This mini project was done after Frequentist_Statistics_mini_projects.  The same data was used in the both project. If you take a look at Frequentist_Statistics_mini_projects in my repository, you can compare the difference of results by the difference of the ways.
